\section{Policy implications}

As the simulation above shows, focusing only on ``blackouts'' in the period immediately after the shock or on the effects of the shock on individual nodes gives a partial view of the effects of demand shock in the cross-border market. In order to identify potential interventions that minimize the risk of blackouts, I will rely on simulating equivalent shocks and using the cumulative number of blackout days as a target metric.

A common policy suggestion in the literature is that of further market integration between regional markets. \citein{Newbery2016} estimate a significant efficiency gain from further material interconnection. Such material interconnection can be modeled in our framework as a network with a more diffuse bargaining power. Let $\mu_{2\I + \G}$ and $\sigma_{2\I + \G}$ be the mean and standard deviation of the influence of each node in the network

\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{(k, m) \in E} (2\I + \G)^{-1}_{(i, j), (k, m)} -  \sum_{(l, k) \in E} (2\I + \G)^{-1}_{(i, j), (l, k)}
\end{equation*}

Then, we can define $\rho(\mathcal{A}) = \left( \sigma / \mu \right)_{2\I + \G}$ be the concentration of bargaining power of a graph. Intuitively, as an edge is added to the node, if the node's power is equally distributed $\rho(\mathcal{A})$ stays constant, otherwise it grows. This can be seen in Figure (\ref{fig:incoherence}) where I plot $\rho$ for the star and path graphs. In the case of the star graph, once a node is added to a $n+1$ graph, the bargaining power of each peripheral edge is multiplied by $\frac{n}{n+1}$ which implies that more power is concentrated in the central node. On the other hand, when a node is added to the path graph, the ``new'' bargaining power is redistributed throughout the graph, maintaining proportions constant.

    \caption{$\rho(\mathcal{A})$ for different graphs and sizes} \label{fig:incoherence}
\end{figure}

For each size and graph, I simulate an equivalent demand shock in the central node. In Figure (\ref{fig:blackout}) I plot the number of periods of blackout in each simulation, that is

\begin{equation}
    \left\lvert\set{t: \ t \geq \tau, \sum_{i} X_{i, t} > 0}\right\rvert.
\end{equation}

First, notice that the path graph never experiences a blackout under the same conditions of the star graph regardless of size. This reinforces the claim that graph and shock size do not matter as long as the bargaining power is evenly distributed through the network. Second, in the star graph blackouts period increase rapidly as bargaining power concentration increases, before plateauing.

\end{figure}

Another common policy tool discussed in the literature (\cite{Fraser1994, Yao2007}) and used in practice (e.g. in Italy, UK, and West US in emergency situations) is that of a price control mechanism. These mostly come in the form of a price cap. This can be modeled in our framework by rewriting the policy function of providers as

\begin{equation}
    p_{t+1} = \min\left\{ p_t + L(X_t, S_t) + P(\Y_t), \overline{p} \right\}
\end{equation}

where $\overline{p}$ is price cap. In Figure \ref{fig:pricecapdemand} I plot ``blackouts'' after the same shock of Figure \ref{fig:demandshock_star} but with a price cap. The price cap prevents price adjustments to induce enough supply and yields stronger and longer ``blackout'' periods.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Excess demand after transient shock in star graph with price caps}
    \label{fig:pricecapdemand}
\end{figure}

Hence, in the current framework, price caps can protect consumers from sudden price hikes but introduce too much rigidity for the system to compensate demand shocks and prevent blackouts.
