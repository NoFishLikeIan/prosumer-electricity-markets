\section{Model}

The model focuses on two aspects of the cross-border electricity market. First, it models explicitly the bilateral trading procedure among electricity providers in the wholesale electricity market, which is a common mechanism of price setting, particularly in cross-border daily contracts in the EU and USA (\cite{Imran2014}). Doing this requires simplifying greatly the electricity market structure, particularly the different time scales at which operators trade, the intra-border competition, and the complex financial instruments. Nevertheless, these aspects can be approximated in my model by tweaking the network structure and these simplifications allows to concentrate on the bargaining-power induced by the graph, and the instabilities these might induce.

Providers set a \textit{local price} ($p_i$) at which they trade electricity with local market prosumers.
