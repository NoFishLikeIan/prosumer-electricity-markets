\section{Introduction}

\section{Research Question}

The project's main objective is to identify the conditions under which a decentralized market for electricity displays aggregate resilience.

The notion of network resilience is mapped to three properties of dynamical systems: systemic stability, self-organized critical dynamics, and Lyapunov stability.

The first arises when a network's critical points are robust to perturbations of its nodes. For example, a desirable property of an electricity market of prosumers is its ability to prevent systematic shortages after a negative shock to one of the prosumer's production capacity due to a climate shock. The second, as presented by \citeauthor{Bak1995} (\citeyear{Bak1995}), concerns the capacity of the dynamical system to converge to display ``similar" critical points independently of time, space, and parameter space. In this context, the pricing mechanism and equilibria of the proposed market should be scale-free. The third property refers to the stability of a solution near the equilibrium. Taking again a prosumers electricity market as example, it is desirable for the price vector to be stable around the market clearing price.

Furthermore, the research question will be dealt with at three dependent levels. First, the resilience properties should be investigated within a theoretical framework. The model should then define the empirical analysis' objectives, the results of which should in turn imply policy implications.
