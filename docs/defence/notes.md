## Motivation

- Theoretical: Gebhardt and Hoffler (2013)
  - "we assumed that spot markets are competitive and that
 cross-border trades do not influence the spot prices."
  - our results highlight an additional advantage
 of "market coupling", i.e., integrating the national wholesale markets
   - Information asymmetries with rational agents
- Empirical: BÂ¨ockers, V. & Heimeshoff, U. (2014)
  - analyzed the convergence of European power markets between Jan 2004 and Jan 2011
  - energy markets could be done by detailed simulation studies of the effects of shocks in some countries on energy markets in neighboring countries.
- Lack of price convergence
