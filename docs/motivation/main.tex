    \opening{To whom it may concern,}

    I am a MPhil student at the Tinbergen Institute in Amsterdam, and I am applying for an EPOC research project.

    Since my undergraduate studies I have always had a keen interest in quantitative economic research and a will to understand how mathematical models can allow one to describe and predict economic variables. Reading economic theory and history was, and still is, the driving force behind my desire to work as a researcher. In line with this, I focused my studies on theoretical and mathematical economics, from traditional macroeconomics modelling and game theory to agent-based modelling and networks. My MPhil thesis, and hopefully bridge project to a PhD, aims at exploring the dynamics of the interaction between prosumer markets and oligopolistic competition markets, with particular focus on agents heterogeneity among prosumers.

    On top of this, I have professional experience and keen interest in computer science and computational methods. Working in a commercial setting taught me the value of interpretation and feasibility of modelling, both statistical and theoretical: seeing models as a mean to communicate ideas and make informed decision, rather than an end in itself.


    The EPOC project provides a great opportunity to apply my skills to a socially relevant and challenging array of issues, in line with my research interests. Project 9 in particular would allow me to to combine graph theory, dynamical systems, computational methods, and economic modelling, while exploring the literature on electricity markets. I find equilibria and self-organizing criticalities in diffused market systems fascinating and would love to invest time into figuring out the best price formation mechanism. Understanding these diffused system can have major repercussion on the energy transition and is a fundamental step towards decarbonizing the economy in an equitable and fair manner. This is an important issue and I am motivation by doing socially impactful research. My second choice, project 5, seems like a natural fit given my skill set and interests. Expectation formation is a recurrent and crucial issue throughout macroeconomics and has always been a tough nut to crack. Research published by Prof. Hommes convinced me that heterogenous agent-based models are the way forward to connect individual and aggregate expectations, and make sensible predictions on aggregate expectations formation. My contribution to this line of research can be to identify where machine learning, which I have extensively used in a commercial setting, can help stabilize dynamics in macroeconomic models, which I have studied in an academic setting.

    In conclusion, I am committed to pursue a PhD because I feel like my time should be focused on better understanding economic issues, and being part of the research community at large. The end goal is to contribute to the understanding and decision making of topics that are impacting or will impact people. Hence, pursuing my doctoral studies within the context of your research projects represents an opportunity, on one hand, to learn and collaborate with experts on such topics and, on the other hand, to move the first steps in putting my skills to good use.

    \closing{Thank you for your consideration.}
