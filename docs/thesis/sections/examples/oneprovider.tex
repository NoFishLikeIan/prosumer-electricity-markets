\subsection{One provider}

Assume that there is only one provider, such that $N_{\mathcal{A}}(1) = \emptyset$. The provider's constraint, at each $t$, reduces to,

\begin{equation}
    X_t = \sum_{j \in \emptyset} Y_t^{(i, j)} = 0
\end{equation}

This implies that the providers needs to set $p_t$ such that,

\begin{equation}
    N \cdot( b + a\cdot p_t) = 0
\end{equation}


This intuitively implies that, given no outside option for the provider, the supply needs to be put constant at the prosumers' demand. If $e_t > 0$, the prosumers' endowment is not sufficient to cover the demand, then the production $S_t > 0$. Otherwise, if $e_t < 0$, $S_t = 0$ (i.e. there will be excess electricity which will be thrown away).
