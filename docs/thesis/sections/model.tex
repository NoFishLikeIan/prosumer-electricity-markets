  \label{tikz:wholesale}
\end{figure}

To address price contagion we first need to model price formation both in the local wholesale market and in the cross-border market. In the former, electricity is produced by producers, consumed by prosumers, and the market is cleared by providers. In the latter, electricity is only traded by providers (see Figure \ref{tikz:wholesale}). Each regional wholesale market contains $M$ homogenous prosumers, with perfectly inelastic demand, and $N$ heterogenous producers, who compete locally in quantity. The monopolist provider sets the local wholesale price, at which it sells to prosumers and buys from producers. In case of excess demand (supply) in the wholesale market, the provider acquires (sells) electricity in the cross-border market. Such a market is assumed to function via bilateral trading in a network between providers. Possibility of trading is contingent on the presence of an edge between two regional markets.

\subsection{Prosumers}

All prosumers in the same region are endowed an electricity quantity from renewable energy and have a constant electricity demand. This is modelled by assuming that an individual prosumer's demand can be in a high state ($\overline{e}$) or a low state ($\underline{e}$). That implies there is a ``representative prosumer'' per region with a given constant demand.

\subsection{Producers}

Electricity production involves a complicated decision process which stems from the high frequency of the electricity market and the inability to ramp-up electricity production instantaneously (\cite{Kumar2012, VandenBergh2015}). The model attempts to capture these features by relying on a one-period offset between the production decision and its attainment, namely, electricity producers operate power plants and can generate electricity by ramping up or down production at a certain cost and with a one period delay. Electricity is then sold on the local market, at time $t$, at a price $p_t$, set by electricity providers, and costs a fixed marginal value $k$ to maintain at a given production level $s_t$. Let $c(s, r)$ be the cost of ramping up or turning down production next period by $r$ when currently at production level $s$. I assume $r$ is bounded between two values $\underline{r}(s_t)$ and $\overline{r}(s_t)$.

The delayed production decision requires producers to form beliefs over the price formation mechanism. Here I assume the belief is that prices will not change between one period and another, $\B_t[p_{t+1}] = p_t$. As we will see later, in the current framework such a belief is correct in equilibrium.

This setup leads to the following optimization problem

\begin{equation} \label{bellman_prod}
  \begin{split}
    V(s_t, p_t) &= \max_{r_t \in [\underline{r}(s_t), \overline{r}(s_t)]} \left\{ s_t \  (p_t - k) - c(s_t, r_t) \  r_t + \beta \  V(s_{t+1}, p_{t+1}) \right\} \\
    \text{ such that } s_{t+1} &= s_t + r_t \text{ with } s_t \geq 0 \text{ given } s_0 \\
    \text{ and } p_{t+1} &= p_t.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

This setup determines $r$ as a function of $s$ and $p$  (see \ref{a:producer_optimization}). In particular, $r$ is such that the marginal costs and marginal benefits of ramping up production are the same. The former are given by

\begin{equation*}
  mc(r; s_t, p_t) \coloneqq r \ \frac{\partial c}{\partial r}(s_t, r)  + c(s_t, r).
\end{equation*}

The producer by ramping up production pays $c(s_t, r)$ and increases the costs of ramping up by $r \ \frac{\partial c}{\partial r}(s_t, r)$. The latter are

\begin{equation*}
  mb(r; s_t, p_t)  \coloneqq \beta \ \left[p_t - k + \left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial r}(s_t + r, r) - \frac{\partial c}{\partial s_t}(s_t + r, r)\right) \ r + c(s_t + r, r) \right],
\end{equation*}

which can be broken up into the profit the producer believes they can get for the new production, $\B[p_{t+1}] - k = p_t - k$, the avoided marginal cost tomorrow of having increased production today instead, $r \ \frac{\partial c}{\partial r}(s_t + r, r) + c(s_t + r, r)$, and finally the increased marginal cost brought about by a higher level of production $\frac{\partial c}{\partial s_t}(s_t + r, r)$. Hence, in equilibrium $r$ is such that

\begin{equation} \label{raw_policy_producer}
  mc(r; s_t, p_t) = mb(r; s_t, p_t).
\end{equation}

Clearly, the ramp-up policy function will depend entirely on the choice of the marginal cost function, $c(s, r)$. A function of electricity production level and ramp-up levels is too tight of a structure to summarize the complex decision process behind the cycling (starting up and shutting down) of traditional power plants (\cite{Kumar2012, VandenBergh2015}). To approximate it, I assume that ramp-down of electricity production has no marginal costs, namely $c(s, r) = 0$ if $r < 0$. Furthermore, I assume increasing marginal costs both in scale of supply, $\partial c / \partial s > 0$, and in ramp-up level, $\partial c / \partial r > 0$. A differentiable function with (asymptotically) this feature is

\begin{equation}
  c(s, r; c_1) \coloneqq \frac{1}{c_1} \ \log \left( 1 + \exp(c_1 \ s \ r) \right).
\end{equation}

Notice that $c(s, r; c_1) \xrightarrow{} \max \{ 0, s \ r \}$ as $c_1 \xrightarrow{}\infty$. In the limit $c_1 \xrightarrow{}\infty$, we can determine the policy function $r(s_t, p_t)$ analytically (see \ref{a:limiting}). This ``asymptotic'' policy function is continuous everywhere but fails to be differentiable in two points. The first trivial interval to consider is that where $p_t < k$. Here producers make a loss at each unit sold, or in terms of the first order condition $mc(r; s_t, p_t) > mb(r; s_t, p_t)$. They will then try and reduce production as much as possible, namely \begin{equation*} r(s_t, p_t) = \underline{r}(s_t). \end{equation*} The second interval is that where current electricity production is too low, namely $s_t < \frac{\beta}{1- \beta} \sqrt{p_t - k}$, which implies $mc(r; s_t, p_t) < mb(r; s_t, p_t)$. In this case, ramp-up will be as high as possible $r(s_t, p_t) = \overline{r}(s_t)$. Finally, the non-trivial case is that of the remaining interval where $mc(r; s_t, p_t) = mb(r; s_t, p_t)$. As shown in Appendix (\ref{a:limiting})

\begin{equation} \label{rpolicy}
  r(s_t, p_t) =
  \frac{1 - \beta}{\beta} \ s_t - \sqrt{ \left(\frac{1 - \beta}{\beta} \ s_t \right)^2 - \ \left(p_t - k\right) }.
\end{equation}

This equation has a few intuitive properties. First of all, there is no ramp-up if there is no unit profit, that is $r(s_t, p_t) = 0$ if $p_t - k = 0$. Second, ramp-up increases in $p_t$. The function is plotted in Figure $\ref{fig:r}$, where I choose, in order to make the function continuous, a maximum ramp-down $\underline{r}(s) = - \delta s$ with $\delta \in (0, 1)$ and a maximum ramp-up $\overline{r}(s) = \sqrt{p-k}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\plotpath/rfunction.pdf}
  \caption{Contour map of the ramp-up function $r(s_t, p_t)$, with labelled the three regions of marginal benefits and costs, separated by the two non-differentiable lines $k$ and $\frac{\beta}{1- \beta} \sqrt{p_t - k}$}
  \label{fig:r}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Local demand}

Given any ramp-up policy function $r(s, p)$, it is possible to find the excess demand of electricity in the local market, that is, the electricity demanded in the local market by local prosumers that it is not satisfied by local producers and has to then be acquired in the cross-border market. First, let $R_t$ be the aggregated ramp-up function,

\begin{equation}
  R(p_t, s_{1, t}, \ldots, s_{N, t}) \coloneqq \sum^N_{i = 1} r(s_{i, t}, p_t),
\end{equation}

and $S_t = \sum^N_{i = 1} s_{i, t}$ be the aggregate supply at time $t$. Assuming that the local market is composed of $N$ producers and $M$ prosumers, the aggregate supply of electricity at time $t$, can be written as

\begin{equation} \label{s_evol}
  \begin{split}
    \sum^N_{i = 1} s_{i, t+1} &= \sum^N_{i = 1} \left( s_{i, t} +  r(s_{i, t}, p_t) \right)\\
    S_{t+1} &= S_t + R_t.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

The electricity demanded by $M$ prosumers is determined by the exogenous endowment $e_t$ and it is assumed to be completely inelastic, namely prosumers will buy electricity at any price from providers or directly from producers. Hence the excess electricity demand at time $t$ is simply the difference between the demand and the supply

\begin{equation} \label{x_inst}
  X_{t} = M e_{t} - S_{t}.
\end{equation}

Note that if $S_t > M e_t$, there is an excess supply ($X_t < 0$) of electricity in the local market that the local provider can use to sell abroad. Given equation (\ref{s_evol}) and (\ref{x_inst}), we obtain the evolution of the process $X_t$ (see \ref{a:ev_demand})

\begin{equation} \label{x_true}
  X_{t+1} = X_t + M \left(e_{t+1} - e_t \right) -  R_t.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Providers}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \input{sections/diagrams/overview.tikz}
  \caption{An instance of the cross-border electricity market}
  \label{tikz:cb}
\end{figure}

The link between local markets and cross-border markets is represented by electricity providers. They are modelled as monopolists in their own local market and are indexed by $i$. They set the local price $p_{i, t}$ at which they sell (purchase) the excess demand (supply) of electricity in the local market $X_{i, t}$. On the one hand, if there is excess demand in the market, $X_{i, t} > 0$, providers sell electricity to prosumers at price $p_{i, t}$. On the other hand, if there is excess supply, $X_{i, t} < 0$, they buy electricity off of prosumers and producers at price $p_{i, t}$. The excess demand (supply) is satisfied (sold) by trading with other providers in the network. Hence, providers trade electricity $Y^{(i, j)}$, at a bargained price $P^{(i, j)}$, with neighboring providers. $Y^{(i, j)} > 0$ if $i$ is buying from $j$ and the other way around for $Y^{(i, j)} < 0$. This also implies that $Y^{(i, j)} = -Y^{(j, i)}$. This framework assigns the role of market makers to providers. This decision serves the purpose of condensing the diffuse and heterogenous interactions that one observes in the cross-border markets into a single agent thereby giving a stylized mechanism of cross-border price formation.

Assuming for now that every pairwise price on the network, $P^{(i, j)}$, is determined only by the vector of traded quantities, $\Y$, the instantaneous payoff of provider $i$ is

\begin{equation}
  \Pi_i(p_{i, t}, \Y_{i, t}) = p_{i, t} \  X_{i, t}(p_{i, t-1}) - \sum_{j \in N_{\mathcal{A}}(i)} Y_t^{(i, j)} \  P_t^{(i, j)},
\end{equation}

where $p_{i, t} \in \R$ and

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \Y_{i, t} &\in \R^{\abs{N_{\mathcal{A}}(i)}}, \hspace{5mm}\Y_{i, t} = \begin{pmatrix}
      Y^{(i, 1)}_t \\
      Y^{(i, 2)}_t \\
      \vdots
    \end{pmatrix}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

is a vector of traded quantities with the provider's neighbors. Furthermore, each period the optimization is subject to \begin{equation*}X_{i, t}(p_{i, t-1}) \leq  \sum_{j \in N_{\mathcal{A}}(i)} Y_t^{(i, j)}. \end{equation*}
This condition requires the provider to always match the quantity demanded in the local market by trading with its neighbors. Note that this implies that electricity across the network flows always towards places of scarcity. In this way, electricity prices signal both scarcity and bargaining power within the network.

The provider's optimization is then an intertemporal problem that depends on the state $X_{i, t}$ which follows the evolution laid down in equation (\ref{x_true}). The provider is assumed to make two simplifying assumptions on this evolution. First, at time $t$, they assume $\B_{i, t}[e_{i, t+1}] = e_{i, t}$. This assumption is a good approximation in the case of a very persistent process $e_{i, t}$. Second, I assume the provider does not know the ramp-up function of producers in the local market, $r(s_{i, t}, p_{i, t})$, hence they approximate the aggregate ramp-up function by a linear adaptive rule, with varying coefficients $\alpha_{i, t}$, $\gamma_{i, t}$, and $ \eta_{i, t}$,

\begin{equation*}
  \B_{i, t} \left[R_{i, t}(p, S) \right] = \alpha_{i, t} + \gamma_{i, t} \  p + \eta_{i, t} \ S.
\end{equation*}

Each period providers observe the realization $R_{i, t+1}$ and pick the coefficients $\alpha_{i, t+1}$, $\gamma_{i, t+1}$, and $\eta_{i, t+1}$ via weighted least squares, more precisely

\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \alpha_{i, t+1} \\
    \gamma_{i, t+1} \\
    \eta_{i, t+1}
  \end{pmatrix} = ( \matr{\chi}_{t}^T \matr{W}  \matr{\chi}_{t})^{-1} ( \matr{\chi}_{t}^T \matr{W} \matr{R}_{i, t+1}),
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
  \matr{\chi}_{t} = \begin{pmatrix}
    1      & p_{i, 0} & S_{i, 0} \\
    1      & p_{i, 1} & S_{i, 1} \\
    \vdots & \vdots   & \vdots   \\
    1      & p_{i, t} & S_{i, t}
  \end{pmatrix} \text{ and } \matr{R}_t = \begin{pmatrix}
    R_{i, 1} \\
    R_{i, 2} \\
    \vdots   \\
    R_{i, t + 1}
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

and $\matr{W}$ is a weighting matrix of time exponential decay with entries

\begin{equation}
  \matr{W}_{t_1, t_2} = \exp(-\abs{t_1 - t_2}).
\end{equation}

Given this setup we can specify the optimization problem of the provider. Suppressing $i$ for convenience (i.e. $Y^j \coloneqq Y^{(i, j)}$) and using the Lagrangian formulation, with Lagrange multiplier $\lambda_t$, the Bellman equation can be written as

\begin{equation*}
  V(X_t, S_t) = \max_{p_t, \Y_t} \left\{ p_t \  X_t - \sum_{j \in N_{\mathcal{A}}(i)} Y^j_t \  P^j(\Y_t) + \lambda_t \  \left( X_t - \sum_{j \in N_{\mathcal{A}}(i)} Y^j_t \right) + \beta \   V(X_{t+1}, S_{t+1}) \right\}
\end{equation*}

where

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    X_{t+1} &= X_t - \B_t \left[R(p_t, S_t) \right] \\
    S_{t+1} &= S_t + \B_t \left[R(p_t, S_t) \right]
  \end{split}.
\end{equation*}

Optimization with respect to the price $p_t$, yields

\begin{equation}
  X_t = \beta \ \gamma_{t} \ \left[\frac{\partial V}{\partial X_{t+1}} - \frac{\partial V}{\partial S_{t+1}}  \right].
\end{equation}

This first order condition requires that the marginal benefit of exploiting current excess demand, $X_t$, should equal the estimated marginal benefit loss next period of changing prices, $\gamma_{t} \ \beta \left[\partial V / \partial X_{t+1} - \partial V / \partial S_{t+1}  \right] $. For example, an increase in prices allows providers to extract more revenue from the current demand, $X_t$, but reduces next period demand and increases next period supply by $\gamma_t$, which have marginal benefits today $\beta \ \partial V / \partial X_{t+1}$ and $\beta \ \partial V / \partial S_{t+1}$ respectively. Providers will then change prices until these benefits and costs are equal. Optimization with respect to an arbitrary traded quantity $Y^j_t$ yields the first order condition

\begin{equation} \label{shadow_price_local}
  \sum_{j \in N_{\mathcal{A}}(i)} \frac{\partial (Y_t^j \  P_t^j(\Y_t))}{\partial Y_t^m} = -\lambda_t.
\end{equation}

This equation tells us that in equilibrium providers will allocate the quantities traded with neighbors, $Y^j$, in such a way that marginal benefits are all equal. The optimization yields the policy function for local prices (see Appendix \ref{a:provider_optimization})

\begin{equation} \label{local_p}
  p_{t+1} = p_t + \frac{1-\beta}{\beta \ \gamma} X_t + \frac{\alpha + \eta S_t}{\gamma} - \lambda_t.
\end{equation}

Given the evolution of the local price (\ref{local_p}), it is necessary to solve the bargaining model between providers (which determines the shadow price of acquiring outside electricity $\lambda_t$). To do so I first impose a ``direction'' of trade, namely a traded quantity $Y^{(i, j)}$ enters positively in $j$ and negatively in $i$, such that

\begin{equation}
  Y^{(i, j)} = -Y^{(j, i)}.
\end{equation}

I assume that the bargaining does not take into account individual market expectations and that it happens after the demand is already determined, such that $P^j_t$ is a function of $p_t$ only via $\Y^j_t$. The Nash bargaining solution (\cite{Rubinstein1992}) is such that

\begin{equation}
  P_t^{(i, j)} = \arg \max_{P_t^{(i, j)}} \left\{\Pi_{i, t} \  \Pi_{j, t} \right\}.
\end{equation}


which yields (see \ref{a:barsol}), for every neighbor $(i, j) \in E$

\begin{equation} \label{bargaining_solution}
  \begin{split}
    P_t^{(i, j)} = \frac{1}{2\  Y_t^{(i, j)}} \Biggl( &\underbrace{X_{i, t} \  p_{i, t} - X_{j, t} \  p_{j, t}}_{\text{revenue difference }}
    \\  + &\underbrace{\sum_{m\in N_{\mathcal{A}}(j)} Y_t^{(j, m)} \  P_t^{(j, m)}}_{\text{outside option of } j}
    \\ - & \underbrace{\sum_{m \in N_{\mathcal{A}}(i)} Y_t^{(i, m)} \  P_t^{(i, m)}}_{\text{outside option of } i} \Biggr).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}


In the bargaining problem we have a set of ordered edges $E$. On each edge a bargaining price and a transferred quantity is determined. This defines the two vectors $P, \ Y \in \R^{\abs{E}}$. Now, let $\Delta_t$ in $\R^{\abs{E}}$ be the vector of revenue difference in the respective local markets with entries

\begin{equation}
  \Delta^{(i, j)}_t \coloneqq X_{i, t} \  p_{i, t} - X_{j, t} \  p_{j, t}.
\end{equation}

At each step $t$, given the adjacency matrix of $L(\mathcal{A})$, $\G$, and $\Delta^{(i, j)}_t$, equation (\ref{bargaining_solution}) can be written as

\begin{equation} \label{matrix_bargaining_solution}
  \begin{split}
    2(P_t \circ \Y_t) &= \Delta_t  - \G \left( P_t \circ \Y_t \right) \\
    (2\I + \G) (P_t \circ \Y_t) &= \Delta_t  \\
    (P_t \circ \Y_t) &= (2\I + \G)^{-1} \Delta_t \\
    P(\Y_t) &= \left((2\I + \G)^{-1} \Delta_t \right) \oslash \Y_t
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\circ$ and $\oslash$ denote the element-wise (Hadamard) product and division. Hence, the bargaining solution gives the following price formation

\begin{equation} \label{Pmatrix}
  P(\Y_t) = \left((2\I + \G)^{-1} \Delta_t \right) \oslash \Y_t
\end{equation}

with associated Jacobian (see \ref{a:jacobian_p})

\begin{equation} \label{Pjacobian}
  D_{\Y} P(\Y_t) = -\diag(P(\Y_t) \oslash \Y_t).
\end{equation}

Equation (\ref{Pmatrix}) shows that the trading prices on an edge, $P^{(i, j)}$, depends only on the state of the edges' two nodes, via $Y^{(i, j)}_t$; the revenue differences across the network, via $\Delta_t$; and the network structure, via $\G$. This function also highlights a pitfall of the Nash bargaining procedure on networks. In particular, if the graph $\mathcal{A}$ contains a cycle, the matrix $(2\I + \G)^{-1}$ is singular, given that the number of equations at our disposable to determine $P(\Y_t)$ is not sufficient. To see this consider the simple case of adding an extra edge in the graph below (left to right). On the right hand side graph we demand a further unknown, $P^{(2, 3)}$, but we do not provider further equations.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{\input{sections/diagrams/cycleissue.tikz}}
\end{figure}

Because of this limitation, here I will limit the analysis to acyclic (or complete) graphs. Extending this model to cyclical graphs simply requires defining a more general once differentiable function $P: \R^{\abs{V}} \to \R^{\abs{E}}$, that models the bargaining procedure.

Now we can use Equations (\ref{Pmatrix}) and (\ref{Pjacobian}), combined with the local optimization (\ref{shadow_price_local}), to obtain an explicit expression of the shadow price of the bargaining procedure, $\lambda_t$. Using the fact that for two different entries $e_1$ and $e_2$, $D_{\Y} P(\Y_t)_{e_1, e_2} = 0$ and $D_{\Y} P(\Y_t)_{i, j} = \pm 1$ (i.e. no direct dependence between $P^{(i, j)}$ and $P^{(l, m)}$ for $(i, j) \neq (l, m)$), the shadow price of the bargaining procedure (\ref{shadow_price_local}) can be written as


\begin{equation} \label{shadow_price_gen}
  \begin{split}
    -\lambda_t &= P^m(\Y_t) + \sum_{j \in N_{\mathcal{A}}(i)} Y_t^j \  D_{\Y} P(\Y_t)_{j, m} \\
    &= 2 P^m(\Y_t).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that, again by (\ref{shadow_price_local}), $\lambda_t$ needs to be the same for every neighbor, such that, for two neighbors of $i$, $m$ and $n$

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    2 P^m(\Y_t) &= 2 P^n(\Y_t) \\
    \frac{P^n(\Y_t)}{P^m(\Y_t)} &= 1.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

This equation determines the ratio of $Y^{(i, m)}_t / Y^{(i, n)}_t$ for each element of the vector of $\matr{Y}_t$. Furthermore, to satisfy the resource constraint, it needs to be true that, $\sum_{j} Y^{(i, j)}_t = X_{i, t}$. These two equations allow to fully determine the vector $\matr{Y}_t(X_t, p_t)$.

\subsection{Making sense of the price formation}

Having derived the shadow price on the bargained quantity (\ref{shadow_price_gen}), we can break up the policy function (\ref{local_p}) into a local effect $L_t(X_t, S_t)$ and a global effect $2P^m(\matr{Y}_{t})$, namely

\begin{equation} \label{local_p_comp}
  p_{t+1} = p_t +\underbrace{\frac{1}{\gamma_t} \left( \frac{1-\beta}{\beta} X_t + \alpha_t + \eta_t \ S_t \right)}_{\text{local }  L_t(X_t, S_t) } + \underbrace{2P^m(\matr{Y}_{t})}_{\text{global}}.
\end{equation}

First, this equation establishes a local relationship between $X_t$ and price increases. If there is excess demand in the local market, $X_t > 0$, then an increase in its magnitude yields an increase of the price in order to increase production. Likewise, if $X_t < 0$, an increase in the excess supply leads to a decrease in the price to lower electricity production. It is important to notice that the provider sets the price $p_{t+1}$, based on observed values at time $t$, which affects the electricity production at time $t+1$. Second, assume without loss of generality, $X_t > 0$. If the cost of acquiring electricity from abroad, $P^m(\matr{Y}_{t})$, increases the producer will increase the price in the local market, $p_{t+1} >  p_{t}$, in order to increase local production. Hence this expression gives a clear mechanism of the transmission between prices in the cross-border market and the regional wholesale market. Furthermore, note that if there is no excess demand, $X_t = 0$, no trade, $2P^m(\Y_{t}) = 0$, and, at the current level $S_t$, the ramp-up function is constant, $\alpha_t = - \eta_t \ S_t$, then the price is constant, $p_t = p_{t+1}$. Hence, in this equilibrium state the producers' beliefs are correct, $\B_t[p_{t+1}] = p_t = p_{t+1}$.

At this point it is useful to compare the price formation mechanism obtained here (as summarized in Table \ref{table:perception}) with analogous results from previous literature. First, equation (\ref{local_p_comp}) links the cross-border and the local wholesale market, which are usually treated separately. Second, it improves on the mechanism developed by \citein{Day2001} and \citein{Bakirtzis2006}, who apply the notion of supply function equilibrium (\cite{Klemperer1989}) to determine prices in a local market of power generators competing in quantities. In their model prices are fully determined by marginal costs and hence do not incorporate excess demand $X_t$ but depend linearly only on current production $S_t$ as a fraction of capacity. On the other hand, (\ref{local_p_comp}) introduces excess demand driven fluctuations of prices, $\frac{1-\beta}{\beta} X_t$, to the equivalent capacity determined price, $\alpha_t + \eta_t \ S_t $. Lastly, it presents a mechanism of influence of cross-border prices on local prices, without relying on the axiomatization developed in the literature benchmark model by \citeauthor{Gebhardt2013} (\citeyear[Appendix A]{Gebhardt2013}).
